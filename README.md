# Flash Chat ‚ö°Ô∏è

## The App

This app is part of the Flutter Course by [App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/) 
The main goal was to create a login page using Firebase üî• and a collection stream to exchange messages in a chat app.

As a plus it was added Google sign in feature with the project.

## What do you need?

Besides cloning the repository you will need to create a firebase instance and follow their step to create a auth and collection for message exchange.
